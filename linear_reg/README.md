In this project, I examine the forests dataset that includes variables on weather and fire risk for locations in Algerian forests from two different regions. 

The dataset is loaded and saved as *forests.csv*

I explore the relationships among variables including:

- temp – maximum temperature in degrees Celsius
- humid – relative humidity as a percentage
- region – location in Bejaia in the northeast of Algeria or Sidi Bel-abbes in the northwest of Algeria
- fire – whether a fire occurred (True) or didn’t (False)
- FFMC – Fine Fuel Moisture Code: measure of forest litter fuel moisture that incorporates temperature, humidity, wind, and rain
- ISI – Initial Spread Index: estimates spread potential of fire
- BUI – Buildup Index: estimates potential release of heat
- FWI – Fire Weather Index: measure of general fire intensity potential that incorporates ISI and BUI


The dataset is a subset of data that was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and then cleaned for analysis.
